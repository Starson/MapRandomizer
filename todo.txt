Release plan:
v36: 
  - fix water FX bug
  - music options
  - fast elevator

sprite customization (?), 


TODO:
- explain about doors being turned blue
- add front page to website
- increase amount of rolling saves?
  - auto-reload in save room to go back a save? (what about in Landing Site?)
- try to fix water-to-no-water bug, using this snippet from Benox
    ;Door transition Hijack
    org $82E659
    JSR $FA29
    NOP

    ;Do stuff
    org $82FA29

    ;And since we are here, lets fix at the same time the entering from water to no water animation bug 
    STZ $0A9C

    JSL $878064 ;add back what we overwrote
    RTS
- throw out seed if too many locations become one-way reachable (to protect against giant softlock)?
- figure out why some rooms are dark (some FX other than palette FX?)
- add back palette FX glows using correct palettes.
- fix palette in Crocomire cutscene when wall collapses
- if feasible, mark collected items somehow (preferably as dark gray dots, otherwise as blank)
- During escape, block backward path using room setup ASM instead of door ASM (so it can still work after leaving room another way)
- make separate option for patching out major glitches
  - include GT code, Spacetime beam (currently patched out)
  - make OOB cause instant death
  - others
- area-themed palettes:
  - remove or fix glows that are wrong color (e.g. Wrecked Ship?)
- Make fast elevators optional
- make option for music: vanilla, area-themed, or none
- Improve save balancing algorithm: don't put single-entrance saves (and refills?) at end of hallways,
  i.e. don't connect to rooms with two doors.
- Add way to export settings from seed page (and export/import on main page).
- With a future ML model, treat Mother Brain room as 0-way (instead of one-way) to ensure items, maps, etc.
  cannot be locked behind Mother Brain.
    - Improve map connectedness so it's less likely for a large area to have only one exit.
- Logic updates:
  - Add speedball strat in Big Pink from 13 to 1 (to top left door)
- Ridley kill still accidentally requires heatProof: fix this.
- Fix map tile at Big Pink bottom missile
- Handle other boss fights like we did Ridley:
  - GT
- Remove Crocomire funny map behavior?
- Handle shinespark_frames=0 correctly (don't require 29 energy)
- Better validation/error-handling of web service
  - push more validation into client
- Option for anti-softlock patches (e.g. in Moat, Early Supers, etc.)?
  - disable acid trigger in Leodox room?
- Put spoiler info in collapsible accordion.
- Include strat notes in spoiler log.
- Add note to strat in Post-Crocomire farming room to get to top-left with HiJump
  (run on platform enemy and jump)
- Switch off ammo (e.g. Missiles or Supers) when acquiring Hyper Beam.
- Use separate worker pool to run randomization (to avoid blocking web requests)
- Add more race-friendly options:
  - Make map stations accessible earlier
- on open mode, don't place items in one-way reachable locations (to keep open the possibility of placing key items
  there later once they become bireachable)
  - on (semi-)closed mode, try placing just ammo first before placing any key items. (just put Missile first
    in item precedence?)
- option to remove fast elevators?
    - They mess up the heat Frames logic in Main Hall + Lower Norfair Elevator Room (though this also wouldn't be
      hard to fix with an override)
- Rust cleanup:
    - Use `serde_json` instead of `json` crate for loading sm-json-data.
    - Clean up error handling: get rid of a bunch of remaining unwrap()'s, etc.
- at end of randomization, make sure G4 bosses are reachable (to guard against a case like Phantoon being locked behind
  Bowling, or a G4 boss locked behind Mother Brain).
- on web site, clarify some things about how logic works, e.g.
    - hellruns may be required if canHeatRun tech is enabled.
- Make Gravity-only Samus palette different from Gravity+Varia.
    - Figure out how this can work with custom sprites.
- Try a different kind of "Open" item placement, to reduce likelihood of items getting heavily front-loaded with good items:
  - Start by placing all items randomly, then check that game is beatable.
  - Similar approach could maybe apply to Closed/Semiclosed?: find a beatable game using random placement, then adjust
    the placements to push unnecessary items further back.
      - Or just improve the current approach by rejecting cases where the set of bireachable item locations grows too
      slowly.
- Be more careful with requirements on farms
  - e.g. Zebbo farm in Plowerhouse Room is not really usable without heat-proof and some way to kill the the owls.
- apply bomb torizo patch (from varia) to make it awake when its item is picked up (rather than bombs)?
- fix color of reserve tank energy in equipment menu (got messed up by colored arrows)
- check boss logic on easy settings:
  - golden torizo should need tech to avoid damage?
  - canBePatient should be required when doing long fight with only Charge?
- put back gray doors locked by enemy kills (Metal Pirates, etc.)
  - decide whether these should still wake the planet?
- consider moving the MB barriers to the right one tile (or two?), to make them interfere less with ice zeb skip.
- move GFX colors:
  - Morph Ball room (blue brinstar), tileset 7:
    - [0x31, 0x32, 0x33] -> [0x38, 0x39, 0x3A]
- add grapple + xray to the HUD on hyper beam collect.
- make the pause map tiles align with the grid
- fix tiny bug: when bottom-left door of landing site is an area transition, the arrow shows up from the beginning
  of the game (due to running the door ASM while loading the game)
- fix map tiles showing next to pause menu area name, which should be black (comes from TR map patch)
- take cross-room strats into account in the logic
- fix fine logic details in Kraid fight:
    - if entering from the right, there may be some energy or item requirements to cross the spikes to get to the
      left (the vanilla game requirements might be a little different from Map Rando because of how the vanilla game
      teleports Samus to the left screen).
- fix graphical problem with barriers not clearing in Mother Brain room (happened next to Crocomire's Room?)
- consider putting map stations closer to the ship? (still balanced to one per area)
- update ammo refilled message box.
- another item placement mode where selected tech is forced
- turn Crateria scrolling sky back on. Update values for the 14 doors here: https://patrickjohnston.org/bank/8F#fB76A.
- fix fake gray door graphics in Kraid room, Phantoon room
- check if map reload is messing up timing at start of rooms (e.g. Beta Power Bombs)
  - or more likely music reload is a factor. Can we artificially trigger reload in Morph Ball room or do something else
  to fix the timing with the hoppers?
    - also look into way to avoid a hit when coming into tourian hopper room?
    (e.g., give i-frames, or try to adjust the spawn pattern)
- shorten mother brain 1 death cutscene? (remove flashing?)
- organize tech on website.
- interactive spoiler map (with room maps, list of possible strats, etc.)
- fix bug where wrong tiles sometimes show at top of pause-menu map
- implement enemyKill in logic
- figure out race condition between fastdoors and Mother Brain room setup. Maybe code around $80836F could be used
  to wait? Though maybe this doesn't matter because we don't want to add fastdoors anyway.
- figure out and fix what's going on with tiles below Warehouse Entrance when it crosses areas.
- fix internal checksum in output ROM
- Possibly shorten Baby Metroid cutscene for quality of life (since it might be necessary to traverse it multiple times)
- add README
    - make
- cross-area transitions
  - to fix graphical glitches (look into using special GFX flag?)
- balance boss distribution (one boss per area, corresponding to vanilla?)
- fix suit graphics not showing after getting suit (consequence of skipping animation)?
- minimizer mode? (select rooms to include randomly, hand-picked, and/or user-selected)
- add strat for jumping over fune with no damage (check osse Twitch clip).
- make map rando for other hacks (e.g. project base, subversion?)
  - would be a lot of work. we could invite others to help implement the logic
- multitroid support
