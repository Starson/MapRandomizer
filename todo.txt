DONE:
- fix save
- skip ceres station
- fix/remove sky scrolling in crateria
- fix door in everest
- fix mission impossible one-way
- fix toilet (keep original door asm for toilet exits)
- randomize items
- fix escape room 1 (add door transition to the right)
- fix save stations (again)
- get map roughly working without overwriting room areas
- open up statues room (which should also fix camera glitch)
- fix blue tiles (from map stations - updated data pointed to by $82:9717)
- fix issue with map areas (statues room in wrong area)
- lock mother brain room behind bosses
- stop escape room 1 from triggering zebesAblaze
- skip fanfares (like in other randomizers)
- skip gravity/varia suit-grab animation to avoid potential hard lock
- change gravity/varia behavior like other randomizers
- adjust sand-fall widths to make them compatible
- fix plasma spark room: map off by 1 tile
- music

TODO:
- fix Plasma Spark Room map (near door down should only be 1 tile, not 2)
- fix suit graphics not showing after getting suit (consequence of skipping animation)
- fix demo
- fix red screen in draygon
- block left side of mother brain room and crocomire room
	- and possibly right of kraid, or change spawn? (camera glitchy)
	  - make kraid a first-time one-way in model, like crocomire?
- graphics messed up after killing kraid
- escape timer
- fix map in east pants room, and homing geemer room
- fix single map tile in toilet
- better solution for fixing toilet door asm
- vanilla morph?
- door above morph ball room is pink but looks blue?
- keep door locks in boss rooms?
    - eye doors before bosses?
- fix new game (instant die after respawn)
- fix big boy cutscene? (keeps happening whenever entering from right, even if has happened before)
- missing power bomb item in morph ball room (ind=1) -- maybe because zebes not awake? (also probably need to make bowling open even when phantoon not dead)
- door doesn't open after killing phantoon
- door randomization
  - tie together plms for the two sides of door?
- refine item randomization
  - take into account obstacles better
  - take into account health
- cross-area transitions
  - to fix graphical glitches (look into using special GFX flag?)
- try to balance map stations across areas
	- convert one tourian save to a map, so that each area gets a map station?
		- remove asm that automatically gives map in first tourian room
- fix map icons
- fix map when going down elevator (set bottom tiles to explored)
- fix botwoon e-tank sand
- fix spazer room music
